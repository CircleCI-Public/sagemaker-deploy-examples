# Demos of deploy workflows with Amazon SageMaker Orb

There are 2 ways you can use these demos.

1) Dynamic Config

To run these examples without creating new projects for each one, you must [enable dynamic](https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/#getting-started-with-dynamic-config-in-circleci) configs in CircleCI.

To choose which example workflow to run, open `.circleci/config.yml`, and update the `path-to-run` parameter to point to the desired example.

2) Stand alone project

Unless otherwise mentioned, all these demos can be stand alone projects. So just make a new repo, copy the contents there, and push it up. It will just work (assuming you configured it right :D)
